Setting up a virtual operating system in VirtualBox
<hr>

Sources I used to finish this project:
  - <a href="https://github.com/pasqualerossi/Born2BeRoot-Guide">pasqualerossi guide</a> | Does not contain the bonus, but has pictures to guide you to set up the VM for the mandatory part
  - <a href="https://github.com/hanshazairi/42-born2beroot#bonus">hanshazairi guide</a> | Contains bonus, but does not show how to Install the operating system
  - <a href="https://baigal.medium.com/born2beroot-e6e26dfb50ac">guide article</a> | Similar to the parsqualerossi guide, downloads more unnecessary things, but wget is useful
  - <a href="https://github.com/HEADLIGHTER/Born2BeRoot-42/blob/main/monitoring.sh">script for monitoring.sh</a> | The script can be downloaded with the wget command, so that you don't have to write it yourself
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BwCO0udUP7MhRh81Y681zz0BalXtKFtte_FHJc6G4s/edit">evaluation questions</a> | Doc document with questions for the evaluation

Do not forget to download the operating system in **/sgoinfre/goinfre/Perso/<your_login>**, otherwise you might have to do it again, because u don't have enough space on your account
