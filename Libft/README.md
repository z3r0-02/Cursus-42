Tested with francinette(works best with Mac): https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette <br>
<br>In there you can find these tests: libft-war-machine, libft-unit-test, libftTester and their own one
 <br>&ensp; * https://github.com/0x050f/libft-war-machine
 <br>&ensp; * https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester
 <br>&ensp; * https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test
 <br> <br> DO NOT 100% BELIEVE IN THOSE TESTS AND MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT
 <br><br>&ensp; &ensp; not all tests need to be passed to pass moulinette
 <br>&ensp; &ensp; the combination of libft-war-machine and libftTester might not be enough to pass
 <br><br> GOOD LUCK :heart:
 <br> Don't get discouraged if you find yourself stuck, or behind your peers, keep going and you shall make it :running:
